title: About
---

I am a graduate student in Anthropology. I have previous education in Business (MSBA) and Engineering (BS in Biomedical Engineering). I worked for a few years in a few federal research labs as a civilian employee and as a contract employee. I am interested in bone health in women of reproductive age and how physical activity and reproductive hormones interact to change bone mass.  My field work is in rural Poland.

I use [R](https://www.r-project.org/about.html) for most of my analyses. In addition to my research, I am interested in good data management practices and understanding how uncritical reliance on "data" can embed biases and assumptions, thus reproducing social or structural inequalities.
