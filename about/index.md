title: About

I am a graduate student in Anthropology.  I am interested in bone health in women of reproductive age and how physical activity and reproductive hormones interact to change bone mass.  My field work is in rural Poland.

I use [R](https://www.r-project.org/about.html) for most of my analyses. In addition to my research, I am interested in good data management practices and understanding how uncritical reliance on "data" can embed biases and assumptions, thus reproducing social or structural inequalities.
