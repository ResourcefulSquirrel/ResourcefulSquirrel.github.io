I am a graduate student in the [Department of Anthropology](http://www.anthro.illinois.edu/) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.  I am interested in bone health in women of reproductive age and how physical activity and reproductive hormones interact to change bone mass.  My field work is at the Mogielica Human Ecology Study Site in rural Poland with the [Human Reproductive and Evolutionary Ecology](https://evoecogroup.wordpress.com) group at Jagiellonian University.
